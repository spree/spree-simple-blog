# Spree Simple Blog

Adds a simple blog to Spree which works much like [Toto](http://github.com/cloudhead/toto/), reading text files in `/content/articles`. Content files consist of yaml metadata followed by Markdown content.

By extending `FileModel`, other types of content can be managed in the same way way.
